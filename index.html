            Unlike most designers, my entry into the field was unique â€“ if not surprisingly unexpected. While a Literary Arts graduate student at Brown University (MFA, 2019), I made the fortuitous decision to study with faculty from the affiliated institution my alma mater shared a campus with. It was in RISD (the Rhode Island School of Design) courses that I was first trained in product design. 

            While still a writer, this experience (and the subsequent certification gained) facilitated collaborative experience working on all as aspects of product development.
